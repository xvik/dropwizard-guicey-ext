# Guicey Server Pages


### About

Brings the simplicity of JSP to dropwizard-views. 
Basement for pluggable and extendable ui applications (like dashboards).

**EXPERIMENTAL** 

Features:

* Use standard dropwizard modules: [dropwizard-views](https://www.dropwizard.io/1.3.12/docs/manual/views.html) and [dropwizard-assets](https://www.dropwizard.io/1.3.12/docs/manual/core.html#serving-assets)
* Support direct templates rendering (without rest resource declaration) 
* Static resources, direct templates and dropwizard-views rest endpoints are handled under the same url
(like everything is stored in the same directory - easy to link css, js and other resources)
* Multiple ui applications declaration with individual errors handling (error pages declaration like in servlet api, but not global)
* Ability to extend applications (much like good old resources copying above exploded war in tomcat)
* Pluggable ui applications (e.g. admin dashboard may be easily installed with a bundle)

#### Problem

Suppose you want to serve your ui to from the root url, then you need to re-map rest:

```yaml
server:
  rootPath: '/rest/*'
  applicationContextPath: /
```

Static resources are in classpath:

```
com/something/
    index.html
    style.css
``` 

Using dropwizard assets bundle to configure application:

```java
bootstrap.addBundle(new AssetsBundle("/com/something/", "/", "index.html"));
```

Note that `index.html` could reference css with relative path:

```html
<link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet">
```

Now if we want to use template instead of pure html we configure dropwizard views:

```java
bootstrap.addBundle(new ViewBundle<MyConfiguration>());
``` 

Renaming `index.html` to `index.ftl` and add view resource:

```java
@Path("/ui/")
@Produces(MediaType.TEXT_HTML)
public class IndexResource {
    
    public static class IndexView extends View {
        public IndexView() {
            super("/com/something/index.ftl");
        } 
    }

    @GET
    public IndexView get() {
        return new IndexView();
    }
}
```

As a result, index page url become `/rest/ui/` so we need to link css resource with full path (`/style.css`) instead of relative
(or even re-configure server to back rest mapping to into root).

It is already obvious that asset servlet and templates are not play well together.

#### Solution  

The solution is obvious: make asserts servlet as major resources supplier and with an additional filter to
detect template requests and redirect rendering to actual rest.

So example above should become:

```
com/something/
    index.ftl
    style.css
``` 

Where `index.ftl` could use

```html
<link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet">
```

because it is queried by url `/index.ftl`: no difference with usual `index.html` - template rendering is hidden
(and direct template file even don't need custom resource). 

When we need custom resource (most likely, for parameters mapping) we can still use it:

```java
@Path("/ui/")
@Template("foo.ftl")
@Produces(MediaType.TEXT_HTML)
public class IndexResource {
    
    @GET
    @Path("/foo/{id}")
    public IndexView get(@PathParam("id") String id) {
        return new TemplateView();
    }
}
```   

It would be accessible from assets root `/foo/12` (more on naming and mapping details below).
Under the hood `/foo/12` will be recognized as template call and redirected (server redirect) to `/rest/ui/foo/12`. 

As you can see rest endpoints and templates are now "a part" of static resources.. just like good-old 
JSP (powered with rest mappings). And it is still pure dropwizard views.

GSP implements per-application error pages support so each application could use it's own errors. In pure 
dropwizard-views such things should be implemented manually, which is not good for application incapsulation.

### Setup 

[![JCenter](https://img.shields.io/bintray/v/vyarus/xvik/dropwizard-guicey-ext.svg?label=jcenter)](https://bintray.com/vyarus/xvik/dropwizard-guicey-ext/_latestVersion)
[![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/ru.vyarus.guicey/guicey-server-pages.svg?style=flat)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/ru.vyarus.guicey/guicey-server-pages)

Avoid version in dependency declaration below if you use [extensions BOM](../guicey-bom). 

Maven:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>ru.vyarus.guicey</groupId>
  <artifactId>guicey-server-pages</artifactId>
  <version>0.7.1</version>
</dependency>
```

Gradle:

```groovy
compile 'ru.vyarus.guicey:guicey-server-pages:0.7.1'
```

See the most recent version in the badge above.

### Usage

First of all, global GSP bundle must be installed in main application class. It 
configures and installs dropwizard-views (global). It supports the same configurations as
pure dropwizard-views bundle.

```java
bootstrap.addBundle(ServerPagesBundle.builder().build());
```

IMPORTANT: Remove direct dropwizard-views bundle registrations (`ViewBundle`) if it was already used in application.  

#### Template engines

Out of the box [dropwizard provides]((https://www.dropwizard.io/1.3.12/docs/manual/views.html)) `freemarker` and `mustache` engines support. 
You will need to add dependency to one of them (or both) in order to activate it (or, maybe, some third party engine):

* compile (`io.dropwizard:dropwizard-views-freemarker`) 
* compile (`io.dropwizard:dropwizard-views-mustache`)

Other template engines available as 3rd party modules. If your template engine is not yet supported
then simply implement `io.dropwizard.views.ViewRenderer` in order to support it.

`ViewRenderer` implementations are loaded automatically using ServiceLoader mechanism. 
If your renderer is not declared as service then simply add it directly:

```java
bootstrap.addBundle(ServerPagesBundle.builder()
        addViewRenderers(new MyTempateSupport())
        .build());
```

Duplicate renderers are automatically removed.

List of detected template engines will be printed to console. You can get list of used renderers
from bundle instance `ServerPagesBundle#getRenderers()`  

NOTE: this is pure dropwizard-views staff (everything is totally standard).

#### Configuration

Views yaml configuration binding is the same as in dropwizard-views.

```yaml
views:
  freemarker:
    strict_syntax: true
  mustache:
    cache: false
```

Where `freemarker` and `mustache` are keys from installed template renderer 
`io.dropwizard.views.ViewRenderer#getConfigurationKey()`. 

```java
public class AppConfig extends Configuration {
    @JsonProperty
    private Map<String, Map<String, String>> views;
    
    public Map<String, Map<String, String>> getViews() { return views;} 
}
```

```java
bootstrap.addBundle(ServerPagesBundle.builder()
        .viewsConfiguration(AppConfig::getViews)
        .build());
```

If `AppConfig#getViews` return `null` then empty map will be used instead as config.

Additionally to direct yaml configuration binding, you can apply exact template engine modifications

```java
bootstrap.addBundle(ServerPagesBundle.builder()
        .viewsConfiguration(AppConfig::getViews)
        .viewsConfigurationModifier("freemarker", 
                map -> map.put("cache_storage", "freemarker.cache.NullCacheStorage"))
        .build());
``` 
   
Modifier always receive not null map (empty map is created automatically in global configuration).

Multiple modifiers could be applied (even for the same section). Each GSP application could also apply modifiers
(this is useful to tune defaults: e.g. in case of freemarker, application may need to apply default imports).

The final configuration (after all modifiers) could be printed to console with `.printViewsConfiguration()`.
Also, configuration is accessible from the bundle instance: `ServerPagesBundle#getViewsConfig()`.

### Applications

Each GSP application is registered as separate bundle in main or admin context:

```java
bootstrap.addBundle(ServerPagesBundle.app("com.project.ui", "/com/app/ui/", "/")
                    .indexPage("index.ftl")
                    .build())
                    
bootstrap.addBundle(ServerPagesBundle.adminApp("com.project.admin", "/com/app/admin/", "/admin")
                    .build())                    
```   

Or inside `GuiceyBundle`:

```java
ServerPagesBundle.app("com.project.ui", "/com/app/ui/", "/")
                    .register(guiceyBootstrap)
```

Unlimited number of applications may be registered on each context.


```java
app("com.project.ui", "/com/app/ui/", "/")
```

* `com.mycompany.ui` - unique(!) application name. Uniqueness is very important as name used for rest paths.
    To avoid collisions it's recommended to use domain-prefixed names to better identify application related resources. 
* `/com/app/ui/` - path to resources in classpath (application "root" folder; the same meaning as in dropwizard-assets)
* `/` - application mapping url (in main or admin context; the same as in dropwizard-assets)
    (if context is prefixed (`server.applicationContextPath: /some` or `server.adminContextPath: /admin`) then GSP 
    application will be available under this prefix)

WARNING: It is a common desire to map ui on main context's root path (`/`), but, by default, dropwizard
maps rest there and so you may see an error:

```
java.lang.IllegalStateException: Multiple servlets map to path /*: app[mapped:JAVAX_API:null],io.dropwizard.jersey.setup.JerseyServletContainer-1280682[mapped:EMBEDDED:null]
```

In this case simply re-map rest in yaml config:
```yaml
server:
  rootPath: '/rest/*'
```

#### Template engine constraint

As GSP application declaration is separated from views configuration (GSP application
may be even a 3rd party bundle) then it must be able to check required template engines presence.

For example, this application requires freemarker:

```java
bootstrap.addBundle(ServerPagesBundle.app("com.project.ui", "/com/app/ui/", "/")
                    .requireRenderers("freemarker")
                    .build())
```

Template engine name is declared in `io.dropwizard.views.ViewRenderer#getConfigurationKey()` (same name used in configuration).   

#### Templates support

As dropwizard-views are used under the hood, all templates are always rendered with
rest endpoints. All these rest endpoints are part of global rest.

But, in contrast to dropwizard-views, GSP must be able to differentiate rest endpoints
by target application. That's why there is a naming convention for template resources mapping path:
it must always start with application name.

Let's see it on example.

Suppose rest is re-mapped from root:

```yaml
server:
  rootPath: '/rest/*'
```

And GSP application is registered with name `com.project.ui` under main context root path (`/`).

```java
bootstrap.addBundle(ServerPagesBundle.app("com.project.ui", "/com/app/ui/", "/")
                    .build())
```  

So application related resources (powering views) paths must start with `com.project.ui/`.

For each application default resource is always registered in order to render direct template files and so
by default you will see in console:

```
INFO  [2019-06-07 04:10:47,978] io.dropwizard.jersey.DropwizardResourceConfig: The following paths were found for the configured resources:

    GET     /rest/com.project.ui/{file:.*} (ru.vyarus.guicey.gsp.app.rest.DirectTemplateResource)
    POST    /rest/com.project.ui/{file:.*} (ru.vyarus.guicey.gsp.app.rest.DirectTemplateResource)

INFO  [2019-06-07 04:10:47,982] ru.vyarus.guicey.gsp.app.ServerPagesApp: Server pages app 'com.project.ui' registered on uri '/*' in main context

    Static resources locations:
        /com/app/ui/

    Mapped handlers:
        GET     /{file:.*}  (ru.vyarus.guicey.gsp.app.rest.DirectTemplateResource #get)
        POST    /{file:.*}  (ru.vyarus.guicey.gsp.app.rest.DirectTemplateResource #post)
```

Here you can see real rest mapping `GET     /rest/com.project.ui/{file:.*}` and
how it could be used relative to application path `GET     /{file:.*}`. 

This report will always contain all correct view paths which must simplify overall understanding:
if path not appear in the report - it's incorrectly mapped and when it's appear - always use the path
from application report to access it.

So if we call `http://localhost:8080/template.ftl` it will be redirected on server
into `/rest/com.project.ui/template.ftl` and handled by `DirectTemplateResource`

TIP: Templates in sub folders will be rendered the same way, e.g. `http://localhost:8080/sub/path/template.ftl`
will render `/com/app/ui/sub/path/template.ftl`. 

When we declare custom resource to handle view it's path must start with application prefix:
`@Path("/com.project.ui/mypage/")` which will be available as `http://localhost:8080/mypage/`

**SIDE NOTE**: I know, it may seem not intuitive at first, but using redirection is the only way
to "merry" templates with static resources and bring usage comfort. Just forget about
real rest mappings (after correct declaration) and use application console report to know the real paths.

#### Template rest declaration

Declaration differences with pure dropwizard-views:

* `@Path` value must start with target application name (see the chapter above) 
* Resource class must be annotated with `@Template` (even without exact template declaration)
* `TemplateView` must be used instead of dropwizard `View` as a base class for view models.

Suppose we declaring page for gsp application `.app("com.project.ui", "/com/app/ui/", "/")`

As in pure views, in most cases we will need custom model object:

```java
public class SampleView extends TemplateView {
    private String name;
    
    public SampleView(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
    
    public String getName() { return this.name; } 
}
```

NOTE: custom model is optional - you can use `TemplateView` directly, as default "empty" model.

```java
@Path("/com.project.ui/sample/")
@Template("sample.ftl")
public class SamplePage {

    @Path("{name}")
    public SampleView doSomething(@PathParam("name") String name) {
        return new SampleView(name);        
    }    
}
``` 

And example template:

```ftl
<#-- @ftlvariable name="" type="com.project.ui.SampleView" -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Sample page</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
    Name: ${name}
</body>
</html>
```

After application startup, new url must appear in GSP application console report.

If we call new page with `http://localhost:8080/sample/fred` we should see
`Name: fred` as a result.

##### @Template

`@Template` annotation must be used on ALL template resources. It may declare default
template for all methods in resource (`@Template("sample.ftl")`) or be just a marker annotation (`@Template`).

Annotation differentiate template resources from other api resources and lets you delare jersey
extension only for template resources:

```java
@Provider
@Template
public class MyExtensions implements ContainerRequestFilter {
    ...
} 
``` 

This request filter will be applied only to template resources. Such targeting is used 
internally in order to not affect global api with GSP specific handling logic.

Template path resolution:

* If path starts with `/` then it would be resolved from classpath root
* Path relative to resource class
* Path relative to static resources location (`/com/app/ui/` in the example above) 

Examples: 

* `@Template("/com/project/custom/path/sample.ftl")` - absolute declaration.
* `@Template("sub/sample.ftl")` - relative declaration
* `@Template("../sub/sample.ftl")` - relative declaration

Even if template is configured in the annotation, exact resource method could specify it's own 
template directly in `TemplateView` constructor:

```java
@Path("/com.project.ui/sample/")
@Template("sample.ftl")  // default template
public class SamplePage {

    @Path("/")
    public TemplateView doSomething() {
        // override template
        return new TemplateView("otherTemplate.ftl");        
    }    
}
```

Template path resolution rules are the same as with annotation.

##### TemplateContext

`TemplateContext` contains all template contextual information. It could be accessed inside template
with model's `getContext()`, e.g.:

```ftl
<#-- @ftlvariable name="" type="com.project.ui.SampleView" -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Sample page</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
    Current url: ${context.url}
</body>
</html>
```

In rest view resources it could be accessed with a static lookup: `TemplateContext.getInstance()`.

This way you can always know current gsp application name, original url (before redirection to rest),
root application mapping prefix and get origial request object (which may be required for error pages).

#### Index page

Index page is a page shown for root application url (`/`). It could be declared as:

```java
bootstrap.addBundle(ServerPagesBundle.app("com.project.ui", "/com/app/ui/", "/")
                    .indexPage('index.html')
                    .build())
```

It could be:
* Direct resource: `index.html`
* Direct template: `index.ftl`
* Rest powered template: `/mapping/` 

NOTE: By default, index page is set to `""` because most likely your index page will be 
handled with rest and `""` will redirect to root path (for current application): `/com.project.ui/` 

#### Error pages

Each GSP application could declare it's own error pages (very similar to servlet api). 

It could be one global error page and different pages per status:

```java
bootstrap.addBundle(ServerPagesBundle.app("com.project.ui", "/com/app/ui/", "/")
                    .errorPage('error.html')
                    .errorPage(500, '500.html')
                    .errorPage(401, '401.html')
                    .build())
```

As with index pages, error page may be direct static html, direct template or rest path.

IMPORTANT: error pages are shown ONLY if requested type was `text/html` and pass error as is 
in other cases. Simply because it is not correct to return html when client was expecting different type. 

Errors handling logic detects:

1. Static resources errors (404)
2. Exceptions during view resource processing (including rendering errors)
3. Direct error codes return without exception (`Resounce.status(404).build()`) 

Error pages may use special view class (or extend it) `ErrorTemplateView` which
collects additional error-related info.

For example, even direct error template could show:

```ftl
<#-- @ftlvariable name="" type="ru.vyarus.guicey.gsp.views.template.ErrorTemplateView" -->

<h3>Url ${erroredUrl} failed to render with ${errorCode} status code</h3>
<div>Error: ${error.class.simpleName}</div>
<pre>
  ${errorTrace}
</pre>
```

For rest-powered error page:

```java
@Path("/com.project.ui/error/")
@Template("error.ftl")
public class ErrorPage {

    @Path("/")
    public TemplateView render() {
        // it may be any extending class if additional properties are required (the same as usual)
        ErrorTemplateView view = new ErrorTemplateView();
        WebApplicationException ex = view.getError();
        // analyze error
        return view;
    }        
}
```

(this error page can be mapped as `.errorPage("/error/")`).

`view.getError()` always return `WebApplicationException` so use `ex.geCause()` to get original exception.
But there will not always be useful exception because direct exception is only one of error cases (see above).

In order to differentiate useful exceptions, you can check:

```java
if (ex instanceof TracelessException) {
    // only status code availbale
    int status = ((TracelessException) ex).getStatus();
} else {
    // actually throwed exception to analyze
    Throwable actualCause = ex.getCause()
}
```

`TracelessException` may be either `AssertError` for static resource fail or `TemplateRestCodeError`
for direct non 200 response code in rest.

IMPORTANT: GSP errors handling override [ExceptionMapper](https://www.dropwizard.io/1.3.12/docs/manual/views.html#template-errors)
and [views errors](https://www.dropwizard.io/1.3.12/docs/manual/views.html#custom-error-pages)
mechanisms because it intercept exceptions before them (using `RequestEventListener`)! So your 
`ExceptionMapper` will be called, but user will still see GSP error page. 

The motivation is simple: otherwise it would be very hard to write side effect free GSP applications
because template resources exceptions could be intercepted with `ExceptionMapper`'s declared
in dropwizard application.  

To overcome this limitation, you can disable errors handling with `@ManuaErrorHandling`.
It may be applied on resource method or to resource class (to disable on all methods).

For example:

```java
@Path("/com.project.ui/error/")
@Template("page.ftl")
public class ErrorPage {

    @ManualErrorHandling
    @Path("/")
    public TemplateView render() {
        // if exception appear inside this method, it would be handled with ExceptionMapper
        // GSP error page will not be used
        
        // Also, if method return non 200 error code (>=400) like 
        // return Response.status(500).build()
        // it would be also not handled with GSP error mechanism (only pure dropwizard staff) 
    }        
}
```                                        

Note that disabled errors will be indicated as `[DISABLED ERRORS]` in console report. 

#### SPA routing

If you use Single Page Applications then you may face the need to recognize html5 client routing urls
and redirect to index page. You can read more about it in [guicey SPA module](../guicey-spa).

As guicey SPA module can't be used directly with GSP, it's abilities is integrated directly and could 
be activated with:

```java
bootstrap.addBundle(ServerPagesBundle.app("com.project.ui", "/com/app/ui/", "/")
                    .spaRouting()
                    .build())
```

Or, if custom detection regex is required: `.spaRouting(customRegex)`

Most likely, usage use-case would be: index page requires some server-size templating.

#### Template requests detection

GSP must differentiate static resource calls from template calls. It assumes that static
resources would always end with an extension (e.g. `/something/some.ext`) and so:

1. If request without extension - it's a template
2. If extension is recognized as template extension - render as template
3. Other cases are static resources

The following regular expression used for extension detection:
```regexp
(?:^|/)([^/]+\.(?:[a-zA-Z\d]+))(?:\?.+)?$
```

If it does not cover you specific cases, it could be changed using:

```java
bootstrap.addBundle(ServerPagesBundle.app("com.project.ui", "/com/app/ui/", "/")
                    .filePattern("(?:^|/)([^/]+\\.(?:[a-zA-Z\\d]+))(?:\\?.+)?$")
                    .build())
```

In case when you have static files without extension, you can include them directly 
into detection regexp (using regex or (|) syntax).

Pattern must return detected file name as first matched group (so direct template could be detected).
Pattern is searched (find) inside path, not matched (so simple patterns will also work).

#### Extending applications

In "war world" there is a a very handy thing as overlays: when we can apply our resources
"above" existing war. This way we can replace existing files (hack & tune) and add our own files
so they would live inside app as they were always be there.

In order to achieve similar goals there is a application extension mechanism. 

For example we application:

```java
bootstrap.addBundle(ServerPagesBundle.app("com.project.ui", "/com/app/ui/", "/")
                    .build())
```

With multiple pages inside:

```
/com/app/ui/
    page1.ftl
    page2.ftl
    style.css
```

Each page could include style relatively as `style.css`. Most likely there will even
be master template (freemarker) which unifies styles and common sscript installation.

This application is destributed as 3rd party bundle (jar). If we need to add one more page 
to this application in our current dropwizard application, we can:

```java
ServerPagesBundle.extendApp("com.project.ui", "/com/otherApp/ui/ext")
```

And put another page into classpath:

```
/com/otherApp/ui/ext/
    page3.ftl    
```

This page could also reference `style.css` relatively, the same as pages in the main application.

On application startup, you will notice new resources location:

```
    Static resources locations:
        /com/app/ui/
        /com/otherApp/ui/ext/
```

Now both locations are "roots" for the application. The same way as if we copied
`/com/otherApp/ui/ext/` into `/com/app/ui/`.

`http://localhost:8080/page3.ftl` would correctly render new page.

There may be unlimited number of application extensions. If extended application
is not available, it is not considered as an error: it's assumed as optional
application extension, which will be activated if some 3rd party jar with GSP application  
appear in classpath.

#### Webjars usage

If you want to use resources from [webjars](https://www.webjars.org/) in GSP application:

```java
bootstrap.addBundle(ServerPagesBundle.app("com.project.ui", "/com/app/ui/", "/")
                    .attachWebjars()
                    .build())
```

For example, to add jquery:

```groovy
compile 'org.webjars.npm:jquery:3.4.1'
```

And it could be referenced as:

```html
<script src="jquery/3.4.1/dist/jquery.min.js"/>
```


Under the hood `.attachWebjars()` use extensions mechanism and adds 
`META-INF/resources/webjars/` as application resources path:

```java
ServerPagesBundle.extendApp("app name", "META-INF/resources/webjars/")
```

Note: you can always see the content of webjar on [webjars site](https://www.webjars.org/) by clicking
on package "Files" column. Use everything after "META-INF/resources/webjars/" to reference file.
